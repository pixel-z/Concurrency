### q2.c
- 3 for loops in which all the threads are called.
- All company, student, vaccination zone are threads.
- Struct variables and mutexes are initialized.
- Simulation ends when all student threads gone through drive.
- Functions used:
    ```cpp
    int randomInRange(int l, int r);
    int main();
    ```

### student.c
- All student threads are send to initStudent function, which allocates     random arrival time for each student and when student arrives then sends it `waitingStud()` function.
- Here each student thread continuously checks for available vaccine zone slot concurrently (applying mutex locks), if it is available then send to `assignedStud()` function.
- Functions used:
    ```cpp
    void *initStudent(void *inp);
    void waitingStud(Student *stud);
    void assignedStud(Student *stud, Zone *z);
    ```
